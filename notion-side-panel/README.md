# Notion Panel Window Extension

This Chrome extension opens a narrow window on the right side of the screen and loads a web page. The extension remembers the page you last viewed so reopening the panel restores that page.

## Usage
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
2. Choose **Load unpacked** and select this `notion-side-panel` folder.
3. Click the extension's icon to open the Notion panel. A popup window appears on the right showing the previously visited page (the first time it opens the provided Notion link).
4. Browse normally inside that window. Any navigation will be saved and restored the next time the panel is opened.
